A bad example of a change is:
To change a row of buttons from positioned at center to positioned at left, a bad change is:
[{{"filename": "music.css", "changes": [{{"start": 17, "end": 18, "content": "justify-content: left;", "action": "replace"}}]}}]
where the content is
<line 17>    display: flex;
<end of line 17>
<line 18>    justify-content: center;
<end of line 18>
Because this change forgets that after the replacement, "display: flex;" is deleted. The correct change should be:
[{{"filename": "music.css", "changes": [{{"start": 18, "end": 18, "content": "justify-content: left;", "action": "replace"}}]}}]
Where it only replaces the line that needs to be replaced.

A good example is:
To make elements in a container more compact (shrinking span),
change from justify-content: space-between; to justify-content: space-around;
to further shrink the span, change to justify-content: space-evenly;

A good example is:
To set cycle mode to be default to single-repeat mode,
change "let currentCycleModeIndex = 0" to "let currentCycleModeIndex = 1"
in "cycleMode.js"
Similarly, to set cycle mode to be default to shuffle mode,
change "let currentCycleModeIndex = 0" to "let currentCycleModeIndex = 2"
in "cycleMode.js"

A good example is:
To add a pop up confirming window for unliking a song,
change
"
const likeBtn = document.getElementById('like-btn')
likeBtn.addEventListener('click', function () {
	this.classList.toggle('liked')
})
"
in "likeBtn.js" into
"
let isLiked = false
function toggleLike() {
	if (isLiked) {
		if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to unlike this song?')) {
			return
		}
	}
	isLiked = !isLiked
	const likeBtn = document.getElementById('like-btn')
	likeBtn.classList.toggle('liked')
}
likeBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleLike)
"
Note that in the replaced version,
it is easy to forget the last part: "likeBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleLike)".

A good example is:
To move the "sound effect" option out of the "more options" list,
Add this button: <button class="action-btn" id="sound-effect-btn" title="Sound Effects">Sound Effects</button>
And delete the option "Sound Effects" from the more-button list:
make this change: {"filename": "moreBtn.html", "changes": [{"start": 5, "end": 5, "content": "", "action": "replace"}]}
